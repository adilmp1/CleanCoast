##1)	No Effective Marine Waste Management System
Every day, thousands of tourists visit Indian beaches, but they are unable to dispose of the juice bottles, snack wrappers, and other plastic debris they produce in an efficient manner.
Most of the time, they litter plastic waste on the seashore. These plastic wastes end up in the sea, where they harm the entire marine ecosystem. 

Oil spills frequently kill marine mammals such as whales, dolphins, seals, and sea otters. Oil can clog the blowholes of whales and dolphins, making it impossible for them to breathe properly and disrupting their ability to communicate. Oil coats the fur of otters and seals, leaving them vulnerable to hypothermia.
Even when marine mammals escape the immediate effects, an oil spill can contaminate their food supply. Marine mammals that eat fish or other foods exposed to an oil spill may be poisoned by the oil and die or experience other problems.


##2)	Damage to Marine Ecosystem

Turtles and other marine animals, mistake plastic as food. Since plastic is not digestible, it remains in their stomach and gives them the sensation of being full, so these marine animals die out of starvation.

If the current trend continues, then the weight of all the plastic in the world’s oceans will weigh more than all of the fish in the ocean



##3)	Decline in Tourism 
A beach littered with plastic waste does not present a favourable image to foreign tourists, and as a result, many of them avoid visiting Indian beaches. 
Seashores polluted with plastic waste give a bad impression to foreign tourists.
 India has many beautiful beaches, which provides a great opportunity in the tourism sector. 


A significant problem is the absence of solid waste management and a system to report oil spills. Numerous NGOs and other organisations regularly engage in beach and ocean clean-up efforts, but they are unable to do so effectively due to the lack of information on the locations of oil spills and dumps for plastic garbage.

The government and other organisations conduct several clean-up programmes 
•	Swachh Sagar, 
•	Surakshit Sagar, etc.
but this alone would not be enough to keep the beaches clean.
We need a Solution that can solve for tomorrow.






#Solution

The goal of our project is to create a web-based application that will let users report issues. Users can report oil spills and garbage dumped in coastal areas. Anyone can use the service, from tourists to fishermen. Users who report issues in the app will get points.

Based on the points the user get they can obtain various digital rewards. 

Various NGOs and Government agencies can use the details submitted by the users of the app to carry out the clean-up process effectively. 



#Users
The major users of the web-app will be
•	Tourist
•	Local Residents
•	Fishermen
•	NGOs
•	Government Agencies


#Implementation

The web app will be built using React as front end Javascript library, in backend we will be using firebase for database and firestore. Waste location is reported and users can upload picture for identification which will be stored in firestore. Collection request can be accepted by nearby users who will then be provided instructions for collection and deposit with map location to collection centres.

#Assumptions and Reference
•	Around 9 million tourists visit Goa every year to enjoy the beautiful beaches. From this figure alone, we can imagine how large the beach tourism industry is.
•	Plastics constitute 71% of waste generated in the Indian shoreline. According to NCCR.
The India recycled plastics market size reached US$ 3,553 Million in 2021.  IMARC Group expects the market to reach US$ 5,020 Million by 2027.
•	For the year 2021, one large spill (>700 tonnes) and five medium spills (7-700 tonnes) were recorded.










#Tech Stack

Reactjs and Firebase

We used ReactJs because it helps to Create Dynamic Web Applications with reusable components. It also improves performance enhancement.

Firebase helped us to maintain Reliable & Extensive Databases.

Open Street map 

We used Open Street Map in our project for users to give the location of costal areas where waste is dumped.
There is no cost to use the data and the source data is available for download and use in derived cartographic products.

React leaflet framework was used.
