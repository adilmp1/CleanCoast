Problems
1) No Effective Marine Waste Management System
Every day, thousands of tourists visit Indian beaches, but they are
unable to dispose of the juice bottles, snack wrappers, and other
plastic debris they produce in an efficient manner.
Most of the time, they litter plastic waste on the seashore. These
plastic wastes end up in the sea, where they harm the entire marine
ecosystem.
Oil spills frequently kill marine mammals such as whales, dolphins,
seals, and sea otters. Oil can clog the blowholes of whales and
dolphins, making it impossible for them to breathe properly and
disrupting their ability to communicate. Oil coats the fur of otters
and seals, leaving them vulnerable to hypothermia.
Even when marine mammals escape the immediate effects, an oil
spill can contaminate their food supply. Marine mammals that eat
fish or other foods exposed to an oil spill may be poisoned by the oil
and die or experience other problems.

2) Damage to Marine Ecosystem
Turtles and other marine animals, mistake plastic as food. Since
plastic is not digestible, it remains in their stomach and gives them
the sensation of being full, so these marine animals die out of
starvation.
If the current trend continues, then the weight of all the plastic in
the world’s oceans will weigh more than all of the fish in the ocean

3) Decline in Tourism
A beach littered with plastic waste does not present a favourable
image to foreign tourists, and as a result, many of them avoid
visiting Indian beaches.
Seashores polluted with plastic waste give a bad impression to
foreign tourists.
India has many beautiful beaches, which provides a great
opportunity in the tourism sector.

A significant problem is the absence of solid waste management and a
system to report oil spills. Numerous NGOs and other organisations
regularly engage in beach and ocean clean-up efforts, but they are unable
to do so effectively due to the lack of information on the locations of oil
spills and dumps for plastic garbage.
The government and other organisations conduct several clean-up
programmes
• Swachh Sagar,
• Surakshit Sagar, etc.
but this alone would not be enough to keep the beaches clean.
We need a Solution that can solve for tomorrow.

Solution
The goal of our project is to create a web-based application that will
let users report issues. Users can report oil spills and garbage
dumped in coastal areas. Anyone can use the service, from tourists
to fishermen. Users who report issues in the app will get points.
Based on the points the user get they can obtain various digital
rewards.
Various NGOs and Government agencies can use the details
submitted by the users of the app to carry out the clean-up process
effectively.
Users
The major users of the web-app will be
• Tourist
• Local Residents
• Fishermen
• NGOs
• Government Agencies
Implementation
The web app will be built using React as front end Javascript library,
in backend we will be using firebase for database and firestore.
Waste location is reported and users can upload picture for
identification which will be stored in firestore. Collection request can be accepted by nearby users who will then be provided
instructions for collection and deposit with map location to
collection centres.
Examples
• Around 9 million tourists visit Goa every year to enjoy the beautiful
beaches. From this figure alone, we can imagine how large the
beach tourism industry is.
• Plastics constitute 71% of waste generated in the Indian shoreline.
According to NCCR.
The India recycled plastics market size reached US$ 3,553
Million in 2021. IMARC Group expects the market to reach US$
5,020 Million by 2027.
• For the year 2021, one large spill (>700 tonnes) and five medium
spills (7-700 tonnes) were recorded.
